# Krigsavers

A collection of screensavers for Gnome.

While trying to program GTK straight in C, use waf, and learn the basics of cairo all at the same time, I managed to produce a small collection of screensavers for Gnome. Not being happy with any of the ones I already had installed on my system, and glancing jealously at the nice stylish screensavers the Mac has available, this is the result:

### Epochsaver

Hey, everything looks better with a reflection. Displays the UNIX epoch.

### Circlesaver

Draws a bunch of faint circles slowly moving across the screen.

### Swarmsaver

An attempt at a simple life-simulation. Doesn't really work.

### Crisisaver

This is just a clock with a fancy interface.
